   ```

## Getting Started

### Database Setup

Set up your SQL database and configure the connection details in `config.js`.

### Define Schema

Define your GraphQL schema in `schema.graphql`. This includes types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

### Resolver Implementation

Implement resolvers for your GraphQL schema. Resolvers are responsible for fetching the data for each field in the schema.

### Start the Server

Start the GraphQL server by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

### Explore GraphQL API

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/graphql` to access GraphQL Playground. Here, you can interactively explore your GraphQL API, run queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

## Example Queries

Here are some example GraphQL queries you can run:

### Fetch all users:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Fetch a user by ID:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: \"1\") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Create a new user:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(input: { name: \"John Doe\", email: \"john@example.com\" }) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```
